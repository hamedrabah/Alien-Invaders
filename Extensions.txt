List of extensions: 

1. Background Music: Cool techno sounding music (ninja.wav), used as background music for the game. The file was obtained under a creative common license and the original file source is found here: http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku/ULTRA_PERSON_VOL4/Komiku_-_ULTRA_PERSON_VOL4_-_03_Boss_6_-_Swoop_attack

NOTE: The background music works much better on Windows computers than on Mac.
